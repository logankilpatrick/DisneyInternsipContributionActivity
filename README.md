# DisneyInternsipContributionActivity

System Software Engineering Intern in the simulation and modeling group. Using C# to build ride models to help solve real work problems and making the happiest place on earth, a little happier.

Built a fully functioning ride model in C# with a multi-disciplinary and geographically dispersed team for an internal customer. Validated the model using real-world data collected by our industrial engineering team. Then used the model to simulate changes that could increase ride capacity. Presented these findings to our customer. 

Developed a Machine Learning/Linear Regression model to predict future wind speeds. Also built a user interface for an internal wind speed calculation tool in MatLab. 

Active developer for Disney's internal ride simulation software built in C#. Fixed bugs and implemented new feature requests from our developers.

Built a continuous integration pipeline on GitLab CI.
